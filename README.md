# VBA-challenge
This repo has been created to serve as a home for a series of VBA Challenges.

There are two resources files.
* Test File - for testing the VBA script
* Stock Data - the final dataset.

# Basic Task 

Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.
* The ticker symbol.
* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.

There should also be conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
