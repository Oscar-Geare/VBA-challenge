# VBA-challenge
This repo has been created to serve as a home for a series of VBA Challenges.

There are two resources files.
* Test File - for testing the VBA script
* Stock Data - the final dataset.

# Basic Task 

Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.
* The ticker symbol.
* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.

There should also be conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

# End Result

Honestly I didn't read the instructions properly to start with so I ended up shoving all the results to a new sheet. Then I realised that if additional data was added to the workbook in new yearly sheets, it wouldn't work properly so I had to exclude the first sheet. Then I realised that if we were adding new data we probably didn't want to process over the old data, so I needed to work out a way to skip that. Then I did that. Then I realised I didn't need to do that. 

At least it was good experience.
